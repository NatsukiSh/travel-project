            <h2>Why Monschau?</h2>
            <h3>"Pearl of the Eifel"</h3>
            <p>
              Monschau is a small, historic town in the German Eifel. Largely
              unchanged for over 300 years, the narrow, cobblestoned streets and
              traditional half-timbered houses have made this charming place one
              of the main tourist attractions of the region. Set in the
              beautiful landscapes of the Eifel region, at a stones-throw from
              the Eifel National Park, it makes an excellent base for hikers and
              cyclists. While popular in summer, it only becomes truly overrun
              for its famous Christmas market in winter.
            </p>
            <p>
              Monschau is unique in many ways. The historic old town in the
              narrow valley of the Rur is reminiscent of the days of cloth
              makers in the 17th century. Well-preserved houses in the
              half-timbered style stand right next to the manorial houses of the
              cloth makers. With the many different sights, Monschau in the
              Eifel has something to offer at any time of the year!

                <p>
                  “Monschau mustard" named after the village of Monschau in
                  western Germany. It is handmade without preservatives, using a
                  combination of spices in a recipe that has been handed down
                  from generation to generation. The mustard seeds are carefully
                  ground twice in a basalt stone mill to avoid heat, which
                  brings out the flavours and aromas. It is produced with a lot
                  of time and effort and the amount that can be made at once is
                  about 1/60 of that of a large mustard factory.
                </p>

                <h5>What I like about it</h5>
                <p>
                  Made from organic ingredients, Monschau mustard has a slightly
                  coarse, rustic consistency that allows you to enjoy the
                  natural texture of the produce. It comes with iconic roasted
                  stoneware container is engraved with the name of Guido Breuer.

                <h4>Zum Haller</h4>
                <p>
                  Do you want to spend a nice evening in a rustic atmosphere ,
                  eat delicious food and drink one (or two) freshly tapped beers
                  from the barrel? Then you are at the destination of your
                  dreams in this restaurant "Zum Haller" in Monschau. The
                  perfect location of the “Haller” directly on the market square
                  in Monschau with Rurblick (entrance Eschbachstraße), make it a
                  focal point for locals and visitors from all over the world.
                  The Haller is part of the so-called “Rurpartie”, probably the
                  most photographed motif in Monschau.
                </p>

                <h5>What I like about it</h5>
                <p>
                  "Zum Haller" is actually a traditional German Gasthaus (inn)
                  with a small kitchen, but the taste is beyond your
                  imagination! My favorite dish is famous Monschau Mustard Soup!
                  When you visit Monschau one of must try dish.

                <h4>Burg Monschau</h4>
                <p>
                  This nearly impregnable fortress of the powerful Jülich Counts
                  was besieged with heavy artillery by Emperor Charles V in 1543
                  and was ultimately overtaken; the town was looted. The castle
                  was only repaired to extend the fortifications of the lower
                  castle. It is used today as a youth hostel and in summer as a
                  venue for concerts and operas.
                </p>
                <h5>Address:</h5>
                <p>Auf dem Schloß, 52156 Monschau</p>
                <h5>What I like about it</h5>
                <p>
                  In summer, the inner courtyard of the castle is the
                  atmospheric scenery for the “Monschau Festival”. Then the
                  presentations of well-known artists and famous orchestras
                  transform the castle into true mecca for music fans. There is
                  still a youth hostel in the castle. Alas, this is why the
                  inside of the building cannot be visited. But even still, a
                  visit to the inner courtyard and the dreamlike view of the
                  city are worthwhile!
